Generic interface to multiple Ruby template engines

Tilt is a thin interface over a bunch of different Ruby template
engines in an attempt to make their usage as generic as possible.
This is useful for web frameworks, static site generators, and other
systems that support multiple template engines but don't want to
code for each of them individually.
