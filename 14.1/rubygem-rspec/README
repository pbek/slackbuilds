Behaviour Driven Development for Ruby

RSpec is a Behaviour-Driven Development tool for Ruby programmers.

BDD is an approach to software development that combines Test-Driven
Development, Domain Driven Design, and Acceptance Test-Driven Planning.

RSpec helps you do the TDD part of that equation, focusing on the
documentation and design aspects of TDD.
