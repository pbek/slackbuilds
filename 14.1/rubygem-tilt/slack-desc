# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

rubygem-tilt: This is useful for web frameworks, static site generators, and other
rubygem-tilt: systems that support multiple template engines but don't want to
rubygem-tilt: code for each of them individually.
