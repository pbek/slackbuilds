# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

rubygem-diffy: rubygem-diffy (convenient diffing in ruby)
rubygem-diffy:
rubygem-diffy: Diffy provides a convenient way to generate a diff from two strings
rubygem-diffy: or files. Instead of reimplementing the LCS diff algorithm Diffy uses
rubygem-diffy: battle tested Unix diff to generate diffs, and focuses on providing a
rubygem-diffy: convenient interface, and getting out of your way.
